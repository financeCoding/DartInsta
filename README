This is a simple web app that was built during the Dart hackathon 2012 TLV
(http://greenido.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/dart-hackathon-in-tel-aviv/)

It use:
1. Dart.
2. Twitter bootstrap.
3. y! pipes for the feeds
4. Instagram (or the unoffical web.stagram API)

It's very simple yet giving us some views of what can
 be done with Dart (and other 'good/old' technologies).
 
Other impressive projects from that hackathon:
* Volfied like game, only much better Ð https://github.com/yanivoliver/DartVolfied
* GraphMVC Ð A modular framework for graph (vertices/edges) data structures https://github.com/habeanf/dartgraph
